title: Why, Hello There - Razorfish Bike Commute Challenge

<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Razorfish Bike Commute Challenge</h1>

<!-- Description -->
As an avid bike commuter, I was delighted to design and develop graphics for the Razorfish Bike Commute Challenge. Referencing Portland's ubiquitous bike lane street signage, I created a repeating pattern meant to charm employees and encourage healthy company-wide participation.
