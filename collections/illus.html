<h1>Zapier Illustrations</h1>

<!-- Rumination -->
<p>When I first started working for Zapier - a SaaS company that excels at connecting apps together to solve automation problems - we didn't really have an cohesive illustration style. We had rocket ships conveying how our product worked, simplistic avatars to convey teams or comic book wallpaper to allude to the feeling of having super powers when using our Zaps. </p>
