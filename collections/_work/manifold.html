<h1>Manifold</h1>

<!-- Description -->
Many academic institutions rely on in-house publishing as a means to promote and advance scholarship and knowledge, but most have remained focused on print as their publishing medium. <a href="https://github.com/ManifoldScholar/manifold" target="_blank">Manifold</a> is a collaborative, grant-funded project whose goal is to create an open-source, web-based platform that moves scholarly publishing into the digital age.
