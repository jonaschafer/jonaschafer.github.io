<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Illustrations</h1>

<!-- Description -->
Sometimes design is illustration. Sometimes illustration is design. And sometimes illustration is illustration.

Please note; while most of these illustrations are commissioned work that was approved and produced as shown, several of them are either personal projects, or rejected concepts for which – in my heart – I still ride.
