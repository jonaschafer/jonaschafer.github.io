<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Webflow</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb"> <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> is a simple but powerful WYSIWYG web-based builder with a big cult-following. Recognizing that certain small to medium-sized businesses and non-profit Webflow clients could really benefit from hiring talented Webflow Experts, they set out to build a mini-site that would give clients a powerful tool for finding just the right partner for their projects. Working closely with Webflowâ€™s internal creative team, I was able to guide the project from concept and design through to approvals and production.</p>

<p class="img-blurb">The site was to be filtered in 3 areas: Location (say, France or Baltimore), Project (say, design help or a site rehaul) and Team size (say, hiring an entire agency or just one freelancer). To help guide the user, and to extend the existing brand identity, I iterated on illustrations to represent each category. </p>
