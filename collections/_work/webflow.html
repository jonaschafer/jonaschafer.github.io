<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Webflow</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb"> <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a>, the millenial's version of Dreamweaver, is a WYSIWYG web-based builder that is remarkably simple and powerful. Yet despite their wide user base and cult-following, they saw an opportunity to connect pro users or "Experts", of their product to clients, such as small to medium-sized businesses and non-profits. Working with their Creative Director, I concepted, designed, and produced the site, along with a whole host of illustrations based on their signature, graident-filled style.</p>

<p class="img-blurb">The site was to be filtered in 3 areas: Location (say, France or Baltimore), Project (say, design help or a site rehaul) and Team size (say, hiring an entire agency or just one freelancer). To help guide the user, and to extend the existing brand identity, I iterated on illustrations to represent each category. </p>
