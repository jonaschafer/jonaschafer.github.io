<h1>Webflow</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb"> <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> is a simple but powerful WYSIWYG web-based builder with a big cult-following. Recognizing that certain small to medium-sized businesses and non-profit Webflow clients could really benefit from hiring talented Webflow Experts, they set out to build a mini-site that would give clients a powerful tool for finding just the right partner for their projects. Working closely with Webflow’s internal creative team, I was able to guide the project from concept and design through to approvals and production.</p>

<p class="img-blurb">The site focused on 3 criteria for matching clients with Webflow Experts: Location, Project details, and Team size. To help guide the clients through the process and extend Webflow’s brand identity, I created an entire library of category illustrations tailored to match the Webflow house style. </p>
