<h1>Duro</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb"> <a href="https://www.durolabs.co/" target="_blank">Duro Labs</a>, is a small SaaS start-up that seeks to create "the" tool for hardware engineers to manage, source and group their product data and compomentry. When the company was in their early stages, I was brought on to help shape their product design, including information archiecture, illustrations, interaction design, and a close relationship with their developers. In fact, during this project I created my own repository of design files which greatly expedited the build times for our small team.</p>
