<h1>NWEA</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb"> <a href="https://www.nwea.org/" target="_blank">The Northwest Evaluation Association</a> is a company that uses the RIT Scale to assess educational retention from kindergarten through the 11th grade. Working with a small local design agency, I applied NWEA’s recently updated brand identity to their interactive web application — thoroughly revamping and testing the UX interactivity, and adding fresh new illustrations to help breathe some life and personality into the app.</p>
