<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb"> <a href="https://www.nwea.org/" target="_blank">NWEA</a>, or the Northwest Evaluation Association is a company that seeks to use the "RIT Scale" to assess education retention for kindergartens all the way up to 11th graders. I joined a small design agency to extend their brand identity onto their website, looking at interaction states and resourcing illustrations to breathe life into this digital application.</p>
