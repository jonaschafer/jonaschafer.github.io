<h1>Retrograde by Zapier</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb">Mercury in Retrograde has become a pop-culture phenomenon, wherein Mercury appears to go backward in its orbit, as viewed from Earth. Because Mercury is the planet said to rule communication, those who are astrologically-inclined expect frequent misunderstandings, scheduling problems and disagreements with friends during this period. To help mitigate this time of year, I worked with a small team to create <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/retrograde-by-zapier" target="_blank">Retrograde</a>, a Zapier-built app that gives Zapier users a series of workflow templates they can use when Mercury enters Retrograde.</p>

<p class="blurb">This work was done at <a href="http://www.zapier.com">Zapier</a>.</p>

<p class="img-blurb">Working with a limited budget and a tight timeline, I quickly created a composition of Mercury using stock photography, and used the purple colors from traditional photos of the Milky Way.</p>
