<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb">Italic Studio, an LA-based branding agency, had finished overhauling the identity for Salon.com, but they needed help extending their work into Salon’s website design. Using Italic’s excellent branding work as a foundation, I applied the new branding creatively and consistently throughout the website, translating the work into a digital context by building new components and refining interactions and other user experiences.</p>
