<!-- Project title -->
<h1>EcoChallenge</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb">Every year, the Northwest Earth Institute runs a web-based competition called EcoChallenge which turns bite-sized action into lasting environmental change. Due in part to its popularity over the last 6 years, the NWEI decided to rethink the platform to encourage better participation and to adapt to a mobile-first environment.</p>

<p class="blurb">This work was done at <a href="http://castironcoding.com">Cast Iron Coding</a>, a web development and design agency. Working with their Creative Director, I concepted a quick brand identity as a value-add to the project along with the full site redesign, including gamification studies and interaction patterns. </p>

<p class="img-blurb">On top of the redesign of the web platform, we created dozens of logo ideas, including the final mark, and promotional applications. </p>

<p class="img-blurb">A big part of this project was to show real-time effects of your action - such as taking quicker showers - and turning that into data (12 gallons of water saved). </p>

<p class="img-blurb">I created iconography and ran a color study to accompany the different categories of action. </p>

<p class="img-blurb">Another facet of the project was to create the ability for any company to create their own EcoChallenge. So the website had the option to accompany a company's logo and brand colors to be a standalone company challenge. </p>
