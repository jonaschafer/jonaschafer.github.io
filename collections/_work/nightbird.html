<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb">Lowry Beall is a huge Stevie Nicks fan, so when naming her Northeast Portland salon, she could not resist one of her favorite songs: <a href="https://nightbirdpdx.com/" target="_blank">Nightbird</a>. But when creating her identity and space, I drew more inspiration from Nordic and Scandinavian design principles than 80's rock iconography. Despite its spare and small interior footprint, the salon's interior conveys a warmth of personality designed to encourage relaxation and conversation. Nightbird's visual identity employs a similar minimal approach, with white washed pine serving as a calming backdrop for the clean and simple hand-drawn style of the illustration and logotype.</p>
