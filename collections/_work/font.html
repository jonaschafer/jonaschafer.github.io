<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Levi the Font</h1>

<!-- Description -->
Becoming a father is an experience better shown than told. After my son Levi was born, I was driven into a frenzy of creative activity; elaborate couch forts, imaginary trips to construction sites, and ultra fast neighborhood races. Naturally, eventually, and possibly inevitably, my creative energies directed themselves towards typography. Inspired by the complicated simplicity of elementary school Tangram games, Levi, the font, was brought into the world. And here in the world it remains. You can even purchase a license from the fantastic designer's resource, <a href="https://www.youworkforthem.com/" target="_blank">YouWorkForThem</a>, right <a href="https://www.youworkforthem.com/graphic/E2376/levi" target="_blank">here</a>.
