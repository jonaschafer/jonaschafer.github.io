<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Classic Ben</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb">As a kid, Ben Leonard grew up exploring the lush, evergreen forests of southeastern Oregon. Now living in Portland, Ben is a seasoned multidisciplinary designer, woodworker, and fabricator. To name his fledgling business he chose <a href="http://www.classicben.com/" target="_blank">Classic Ben</a>; which conveys Ben's timeless, minimalist design sensibility, but remains general enough for a flexible range of product applications. Many of the visual cues we created for Classic Ben's identity refer back to Ben's lifelong love of the outdoors, as well as the precision, craft, and utility of his work.</p>

<p class="img-blurb">The tree was a nod to the iconic Oregon state tree, the Doug fir, framed around a woodworker's square, a tool used to measure precise angles.</p>

<p class="img-blurb">For the back end view, the idea was to switch to a Pro mode, with a tighter grid to focus on the higher information density.</p>
