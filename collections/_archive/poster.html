title: Why, Hello There - Walnut Poster
---

<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Walnut Poster</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<a href="http://www.walnutstudiolo.com/" target="_blank">Walnut</a> wanted help showcasing their products for wholesalers, but rather than print yet another catalog to be stacked in yet another pile of catalogs, we enlisted Jim Golden to make a big, beautiful image for us. The final, large printed poster, featuring all of Walnut's products artfully arranged, was designed to be as suitable for framing as it was irresistible to taping onto the walls of shipping and receiving offices the world over.
