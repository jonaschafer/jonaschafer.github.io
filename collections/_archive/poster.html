<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb"><a href="http://www.walnutstudiolo.com/" target="_blank">Walnut</a>, a two person company located on the hazy Oregon coast, specializes in handcrafted wares for the home and bike. After just a year of online sales through their Etsy store, they needed a way to showcase all of their products to clammoring wholesalers and retailers. Inspired by the concept of <a href="https://makezine.com/2016/12/07/zen-and-the-art-of-knolling/" target="_blank">knolling</a>, I asked our photographer friend <a href="https://jimgoldenstudio.com/" target="_blank">Jim Golden</a> to create a larger-than-life collage of their products. The result is a complex but interesting view of their entire catalog, along with the bike that started the whole company. In addition to the poster, I coded up a page on their Shopify site that showed the poster and numbers of each product to understand what each item was. </p>
