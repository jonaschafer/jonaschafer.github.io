<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Medigap</h1>

<!-- Description -->
While not an ideal pace, in just one month over 30 individual pages were concepted, comped and produced for AllCare Medigap, a supplemental Medicare insurance company. Accessibility was a strong concern given the audience's comfort level, so a variety of tools were employed such as a clear sense of hierarchy, breathing room and type scaling.
