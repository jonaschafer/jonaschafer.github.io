title: Why, Hello There - Vote Solar

<!-- Project title -->
<h1>Vote Solar</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p><a href="http://www.votesolar.org/" target="_blank">Vote Solar</a> is a San Francisco-based nonprofit dedicated to promoting the benefits of solar power. They do this through grassroots initiatives, lobbying, and a detailed annual infographic charting America's top 25 solar users. To present the complex and detailed data, I gathered it all under a relatable conceptual framework; specifically, a giant, endless thermometer, and an impossibly tall building. The playful illustration work makes the information density more approachable, and perhaps even fun.</p>
