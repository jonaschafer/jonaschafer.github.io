<h1>Pair of Thieves</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb">When <a href="http://www.pairofthieves.com/" target="_blank">Pair of Thieves</a> began planning their move from Squarespace to Shopify, they took the opportunity to revisit every aspect of their website experience. This top-to-bottom redesign left no stone unturned; nearly every element of the site was reviewed and redesigned, from the top-level structure and navigation, down to the most minute interface details. The result is an engaging showcase for their irresistible graphic patterns and playful personality.</p>
