<h1>Nike 2021</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb">Nike 2021 was a 3-hour gaming event that was part executive training session and part team-building exercise. Set in the year 2021, the game presented volatile economic and social scenarios requiring fast-thinking business decisions and collaborative gameplay. Due to the confidential information contained throughout the game, we decided to exaggerate its secrecy and sensitivity at every opportunity. Themes of espionage, spy-craft, and global crisis were applied to all aspects of the experience; from the details of the game itself, to the design of the physical location, to the theatrical choreography of the game-day presentation.</p>

<p class="img-blurb">Secret Service-type actors (not shown) were at the door, with a wall of Pelican cases to hand to each team member. The contents: the board game, the first round of event questions and a custom black dry erase clipboard for notes. Handcuffs optional.</p>

<p class="img-blurb">Shown: every piece of collateral from the event, the Pelican case which contained the board game, black dry-erase board, game pieces, markers and jars. The collateral was a staged series of envelopes with questions, data and then answers. Also shown: stickers, table team cards, and ephemera from the era the concept is based.</p>
