<!-- Description -->
<p class="blurb"><a href="http://www.insidetrack.com/" target="_blank">InsideTrack</a> is an education consulting company that seeks to increase student enrollment, on-going support and graduation rates. Based in both San Francisco and Portland, their company was going through a rebrand and with it they need a grip of illustrations to support their on-going needs. I created over 100 illustrations, and compositions for brand applications that spanned internal presentations to infographics to promotional materials.</p>
