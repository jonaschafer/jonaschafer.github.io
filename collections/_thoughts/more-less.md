# More and less

Every Friday morning my inbox is blessed with Tim Ferriss' so-called <a href="https://tim.blog/welcome-to-5-bullet-friday/">"5 Bullet Friday"</a>, a collection of easily-digestible links to books, people, products and ideas that are rattling around in his head that week. The one I received a week before year's end was pretty interesting: he arguest _against_ New Year's Resolutions:

<blockquote>
  I’m often asked about how I approach New Year’s resolutions. The truth is that I no longer approach them at all, even though I did for decades. Why the change? I have found “past year reviews” (PYR) more informed, valuable, and actionable than half-blindly looking forward with broad resolutions. I did my first PYR after a mentor’s young daughter died of cancer on December 31st, roughly eight years ago, and I’ve done it every year since. It takes 30-60 minutes
</blockquote>

He goes on to describe how it works, which is straightforward though a little unrealistic: go through the previous year, week by week, evaluating what went well and what didn't. Who keeps detailed records like that? While I love that idea conceptually (you can read how to do it <a href="https://tim.blog/2018/12/28/past-year-review/">here</a>), I felt like there could be a simpler way. That's when I saw [this](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2018/12/more-less-2.html).

First off, I love the list of items this person chose (more Japan!). But I also love the broadstrokes. I could see taping this poster on the wall behind my computer or on the fridge for my wife and I to reference, to keep us positive and self aware.

To that end, here's a recap of 2018:

<div class="umbrella">
  <div class="umbrella-left">
