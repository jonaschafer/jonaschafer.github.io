# More and less

Every Friday my inbox is blessed with Tim Ferriss' so-called <a href="https://tim.blog/welcome-to-5-bullet-friday/">"5 Bullet Friday"</a>, a collection of easily-digestible links to books, people, products and ideas that is rattling around in his head. TBH, they're hit or miss. One week might be some kind nutritional supplement that touts memory retention. While other weeks, like his last one before the end of the year, reflects on avoiding New Year's Resolutions:

<blockquote>
  I’m often asked about how I approach New Year’s resolutions. The truth is that I no longer approach them at all, even though I did for decades. Why the change? I have found “past year reviews” (PYR) more informed, valuable, and actionable than half-blindly looking forward with broad resolutions. I did my first PYR after a mentor’s young daughter died of cancer on December 31st, roughly eight years ago, and I’ve done it every year since. It takes 30-60 minutes
</blockquote>

He goes on to describe how it works, which is straightforward, but a little unrealistic (you can read how to do it <a href="https://tim.blog/2018/12/28/past-year-review/">here</a>). For instance, he suggests going through your calendar of the previous year and pouring over each week on what went well, and what didn't. While I love that idea conceptually, unless I kept an active journal (read: I don't), then it would be pretty darn hard to drum up this information.

However, I do think there is something to this idea of consciously jotting down what resonates and what detracts from your day, week or month. It's an opportunity for self-reflection which can lead to improvement.
