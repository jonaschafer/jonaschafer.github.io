<h1>Before we begin</h1>

<!-- Rumination -->
<p>I'm not a developer.</p>

<p>I do have a strong foundation in development, however. I grew up tinkering with SCSI cables and MS-DOS scripts with my Dad. I learned BASIC in high school, and have built way too many static sites over the years. Heck, I even took a course in Front End Development at Treehouse a few years back.</p>

<p>But it's like the saying goes: "If you don't use it, you lose it." Looking back, I'd stop messing around with code when I got stuck (and couldn't see a way through). Or a freelance project would end and needing to use Git on a daily basis waned heavily.</p>

<p>This site is meant to be a sandbox to help me keep at learning code. That could mean changing the design of the site, trying out a CSS experiment, or just writing more. So, before we begin, I wanted to kick off this post with a hopefully-quick intro to how I set up this site on Jekyll.</p>

<h4>So, what is Jekyll?</h4>
<p>Jekyll is a "static site generator", which means it takes markdown files (and other files too, like Liquid which I don't mess with) and converts them to HTML. Why would you need this, you might ask? Because you can focus on writing in Markdown, which is lightweight, and Jekyll will take care of pretty much everything else.</p>

<pre class="language-bash">gem install jekyll bundler</pre>
