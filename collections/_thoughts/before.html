<h1>Before we begin</h1>

<!-- Rumination -->
<p>I'm not a developer.</p>

<p>I do have a strong foundation in development, however. I grew up tinkering with SCSI cables and MS-DOS scripts with my Dad. I learned BASIC in high school, and have built way too many static sites over the years. Heck, I even took a course in Front End Development at Treehouse a few years back.</p>

<p>But it's like the saying goes: "If you don't use it, you lose it." Looking back, I'd stop messing around with code when I got stuck (and couldn't see a way through). Or a freelance project would end and needing to use Git on a daily basis waned heavily.</p>
