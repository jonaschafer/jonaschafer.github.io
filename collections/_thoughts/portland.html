<!-- Rumination -->
<p>There's a concept in Roman mythology called a Feity. It's a simple premise: you hurt yourself to prove how much you love something (like a Roman Emperor (leave it to the Romans to come up with such a macambre idea)). I first heard about the term when listening to my favorite comedian, Patton Oswalt, and his semi-famous bit about KFC's ill-conceived "Mega Leg." He compared eating the unnatural chicken leg to a Feity of KFC's devotion.</p>

<p>But lately that term has bubbled up in my subconscious as I see my city,  Portland, Oregon, morph into a new version of itself that is a distant cry from what I moved here for. It's like I'm having a conversation with Portland, an invisible entity:</p>

<p>Portland: "You love Portland, huh? Prove it!"</p>
<p>Me: How?</p>
<p>Portland: "We will tear down this beautiful mid-century next to you and replace it with a windowless, 35 foot tower and sell it for $800,000! Do you still love us now?"</p>
<p>Me: "Geez, Portland. That sounds like it would really ruin my quality of life and shut out views of the surrounding trees."</p>
<p>Portland: "Bwahahaha. Now kneel!"</p>

<p>It doesn't help that I keep finding myself in conversations with new arrivals, fresh from cities like San Francisco and D.C., who are not only unfazed by the development pains but actually welcome it. They justify the demolition of historic homes and the raizing of the Mega Mansion Monoliths they are getting replaced with by saying more people can live here.</p>

<p>After 15 years in this city, we are starting to talk about leaving. At this point it's all talk - we have friends, jobs and schools that we are rooted in - but the conversation has lead me to a wall: what is it that I love about Portland? So I'd like to hash that out here, and figure out:</p>
