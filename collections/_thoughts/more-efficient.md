# Efficiency (at running)

My relationship with running is complicated. I, like most everyone else I know, _hated it_ in high school. Maybe it was because of the unexplained short cotton shorts schools insisted you wear, but the idea of running 4 laps around an orange, semi-soft circle was a dreaded activity.

Then again, shortly after moving to Portland and joining the "working week", I fell into a close knit group of friends who were all runners. I was somehow coerced into running a frigid 5K in March and, shortly thereafter, was hooked. These same friends wrote a training plan and I steadily increased my weekly frequency from 1 day a week to 6, and my mileage from a few blocks to 13 miles.

Even though that was a decade ago, I loved the momentum of having a healthy running habit. The momentum of running nearly every day was powerful. For instance, one run might have felt like a battle, which forces you to reflect on how to improve. Or a run might result in a new "Personal Best" and that experience pushing to keep at it. The simple act of lacing up some garrish-looking kicks and monitoring your pace was addicting.

But now I'm almost 40 and have been getting back into running for the past year or so. My frequency is about 3 days a week, and my weekly mileage is about 10 miles. In the past, I wanted to run faster or maybe further but now that I'm older I was just want to be more efficient. I want to run up a hill and not feel like a sack of potatoes, or run down hill and not feel like the Tin Man in desperate need of grease. I want to lace up, do some minimal stretching and feel confident and excited.

So, I've started doing a bit of research into how to do this. I've searched for <span class="code">V02max</span> and <span class="code">vV02max</span> to try and glean some exercises that would help me. That's when I read about <a href="https://lwcoaching.com/interval-training-the-scientific-way/">Veronique Billat</a>. She's a petite French professor who did some HIIT-inspired studies on increasing these values and eventually landed on the 30/30, 60/60 and 180/180. Here's how that works:

## Veronique Billat's Intervals

<ul class="indent">
  <li>Jog it out for ~10 mins</li>
  <li>Reach a pace you can sustain for 6 mins</li>
  <li>Do this for 30 seconds</li>
  <li>Double that pace and jog it for 30 seconds</li>
  <li>Do 12-20</li>
</ul>

Eventually you should find these to be easy (apparently that takes 4-6 weeks) and then you can switch to 6-12 60/60 intervals, and then no more than 5 180/180 intervals.

Another approach to getting faster, which in turn translates to a more efficient exchange of oxygen consumption, is finishing each run with a "stride", or a short burst of an accelerated effort. This will increase form, mechanics and cadence. Here's how that works:

## Strides

<ul class="indent">
  <li>Go hard to 95% speed</li>
  <li>Hold for 2-3 seconds</li>
  <li>Slow to stop</li>
  <li>Take ~1 min-ish to walk/rest</li>
  <li>Do 4-6 strides</li>
</ul>

For full discosure, I've only done each of these methods once. The former wasn't as atrocious as I thought it'd be and strides feel like a natural, kid-like way to end your session. Maybe my dream of being efficient isn't possible a decade later from my Glory Days, or maybe I should be searching for another goal. But at the moment I like the idea of trying these simplistic methods, so I can start feeling like a runner and stop looking like <a href="https://youtu.be/2vkgUL-J0Fg">an anthropormorphic pot of noodles.</a>
