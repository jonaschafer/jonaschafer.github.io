# Hiking the Timberline Trail

I first hiked the Timberline Trail with my friend Bobby <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonagold/sets/72157601400764902/" target="_blank">way back in 2005</a>. We read about it in one of our many hiking guides and thought "Gee, this sounds ambitious, let's give it a go!" So we left way too early in the season, packed _way_ too much gear and set off.

Though we hit snow and ultimately had to turn around and do an out-and-back 39 mile hike, it was a blast. And the hike forever stayed with me as something I wanted to do again. Fast forward to 2014 and my friend, Chad, decided to try it out. He would be driving from eastern Oregon and we'd meet in the middle.

We started late - around 2pm - but hit the trail at a fast clip. This year I went ultra-svelte carrying just 25 lbs of gear. I had either lost or gave away all of my old gear so I had to start anew, opting for higher-priced and lower-weighted gear so my haul was feathelight compared to Chad's hefty 45 lbs. It made a big difference: in just 3 days we completed the trail, with the last leg covering a staggering 19.5 miles - a feat I'm still proud of.

We tried again in 2016 but due to unforseen family complications we had to cut it short. This year, 2019, we are going to try again. To that end, I thought I would compile a list of helpful links, images and lessons learned from the past years. Here goes!

**A word on packing salami:
Some dry sausages are shelf stable. Dry sausages include: Soppersata (a name of a salami); Salami; air-dried Pepperoni; Cerevelat; Lola, Lolita, and Lyons sausage (mildly seasoned pork with garlic); and Genoa salami (an Italian sausage usually made from pork, but might contain a small amount of beef and be moistened with wine or grape juice and seasoned with garlic).
