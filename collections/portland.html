<h1>I love you, but you're bringing me down</h1>

<!-- Rumination -->
<p>There's a concept in Roman mythology called a Feity. It's a simple premise: you hurt yourself to prove how much you love something (like a Roman Emperor, say). I first heard about the term when listening to my favorite comedian, Patton Oswalt, and his semi-famous bit about KFC's ill-conceived "Mega Leg." He compared eating the unnaturally-large chicken leg as a feity to your love of KFC's tyrannical food gluttony.</p>

<p>But lately the idea of Feity has bubbled up in my subconscious in an expected way: my city, Portland, Oregon, is experience growing pains and it's as if the city is asking it's long-term residents to hurt themselves to prove that they still love it here. If it were possible to have a conversation with the town, it might go like this: </p>

<!-- Conversation window -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="terminal__chrome">
    <span class="terminal__dot"></span>
    <span class="terminal__dot"></span>
    <span class="terminal__dot"></span>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Portland</strong>: You really love me? Prove it!</p>
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: ...huh-huh-how?</p>
  <p><strong>Portland</strong>: What if we tear down all the architectural character you've come to cherish about me, and replace it with a windowless, 35 foot MonolithMansionâ„¢ for millionaires!</p>
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: Th-th-that sounds really awful, Portland. I know we need more housing for people to live here, but not at the expense of increasing income inequality and gentrification, not to mention forcing long term residents to leave.</p>
  <p><strong>Portland</strong>: Too bad! Now kneel!</p>
</div>

<p>It doesn't help that I keep finding myself in conversations with new arrivals who are completely unfazed by the nuance of these building pains or their need for chain stores on every block like NYC. This is probably because they are fresh from cities like San Francisco and D.C. where that kind of way of life is old news. In fact, I could imagine another conversation: </p>

<!-- Conversation window -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="terminal__chrome">
    <span class="terminal__dot"></span>
    <span class="terminal__dot"></span>
    <span class="terminal__dot"></span>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Portland</strong>: Hey! You know that bar you love, the Savoy, that's been here for 30 years? We just tripled their rent.</p>
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: Wait. Why? Huh? WHY.</p>
  <p><strong>Portland</strong>: Yeah, we think it'd be better to have an artisanl mayonnaise store instead. Shots of the fatty mixture for $12. Pretty great right? We're coming for you, Brooklyn!</p>
  <p><strong>Me</strong>: ...</p>
</div>

<p>So after 15 years of living in this city, I'm now starting to question what it is I moved here for, what I love about this town and what, if anything, we could move to that would alleviate these woes. Here goes: </p>
