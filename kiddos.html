title: Musings on Levi & Cassidy
---

<p>While working at Zapier, we used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> (a static site generator) on an internal branding project. It wasn't my first experience with code, but it was my first time working with Jekyll. I was struck by how refreshingly straightforward the setup was, and resolved to start using it weekly to encourage myself to code, and write, more.</p>

<p>So this is a journal of sorts, dedicated to capturing the observations of my two kids, Levi and Cassidy. The moments that photos and videos can't capture, and are sometimes the hardest to remember.</p>
