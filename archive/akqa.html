<h1>AKQA</h1>

<!-- Description -->
AKQA is an internationally-recognized ad agency who operates at the "bleeding edge" of digital creative. I've worked with them off and on over the last few years on countless Nike digital projects, ranging from art direction to design to prototyping and social strategy. Here's a small sample of that work.
