      <h6>What's this about?</h6>

<p>While working at Zapier, we used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> (a static site generator) on an internal branding project. It wasnâ€™t my first experience with code, but it was my first time working with Jekyll. I was struck by how refreshingly straightforward the setup was, and resolved to start using it daily to encourage myself to code, and write, more.</p>

<p>So this is a journal of sorts, dedicated to capturing the observations of my two kids, Levi and Cassidy, who at the time of writing are 5 and 2 respectively. I always have my folders of photos and movies, but this is more about documenting the little moments that are often the hardest to remember.</p>
