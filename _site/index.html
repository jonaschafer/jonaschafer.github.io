<p>Pargraph 1 description. When I first heard about Notion (on a freelance project for <a href="https://webflow.com">Link</a>), I was instantly impressed by the friendly illustrations, intuitive UX and the minimally-executed UI. Though Iâ€™ve only just begun to scratch the surface, I have become engrossed in the product and use it on every new freelance project.</p>

<p>Paragraph 2. So when I received your email about my increased frequency, it got me to thinking: I have a lot of ideas on how to improve or extend Notion and I would love to be a part of the team to help shape them.</p>
